Side-by-side code examples from RosettaCode to help you learn any language basing on some that you know.

It used to work by fetching code from RosettaCode from any two languages so that one could get a quick look at how the syntax looked like for a new language in comparison to one they already knew. It stopped working when RosettaCode changed the way it formatted its code samples and this software started showing all the code in a single line for some reason and I didn't want to try to fix it because it had been so many years and very few usage.

I think this was my first project in Go. It is interesting that it died at the same time I've transitioned from considering Go my primary language and starting like Scala more -- and went to the website again (which first was at rosetta.alhur.es and later rosetta.fiatjaf.com) to compare Go against Scala, thus noticing the bug.
